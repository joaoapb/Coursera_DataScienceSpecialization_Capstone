# Coursera Data Science Specialization - Capstone

## .gitignore

The data will be on an ignored folder, since it has 548MB zipped.

## Course Tasks

This course will be separated into 8 different tasks that cover the range of activities encountered by a practicing data scientist. They mirror many of the skills you have developed in the data science specialization. The tasks are:

-Understanding the problem
-Data acquisition and cleaning
-Exploratory analysis
-Statistical modeling
-Predictive modeling
-Creative exploration
-Creating a data product
-Creating a short slide deck pitching your product

## Deliveries of the Capstone Project:

1. An introductory quiz to test whether you have downloaded and can manipulate the data.
2. An intermediate R markdown report that describes in plain language, plots, and code your exploratory analysis of the course data set.
3. Two natural language processing quizzes, where you apply your predictive model to real data to check how it is working.
4. A Shiny app that takes as input a phrase (multiple words), one clicks submit, and it predicts the next word.
5. A 5 slide deck created with R presentations pitching your algorithm and app to your boss or investor.

## Course dataset

This is the training data to get you started that will be the basis for most of the capstone. You must download the data from the link below and not from external websites to start.

This is built by large databases comprising of text in a target language are commonly used when generating language models for various purposes. In this exercise, you will use the English database but may consider three other databases in German, Russian and Finnish.

Later in the course you may use external data sets to augment your model as you see fit.
